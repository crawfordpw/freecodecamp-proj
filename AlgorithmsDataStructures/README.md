# JavsScript Algorithms and Data Structures

This directory is for the five projects in the responsive web design section on https://learn.freecodecamp.org/. This section
could've easily been completed on freecodecamp's website in their browser editor and not need a git repo, but I decided to
use Node.js as an environment and to add their tests to a seperate file to easily look back at these projects if needed and to learn a little more
than I would in the browser.
