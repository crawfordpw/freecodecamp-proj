# APIs and Microservices

This directory is for the five projects in the APIs and microservices section on https://learn.freecodecamp.org/. Since these projects focus on learning this part of the backend, the frontend just consists of the bare minimum necessary to fulfill the user stories with little to no styling. These projects make use of the Node.js runtime environmet, the Express framework, and Mongoose with MongoDB.
